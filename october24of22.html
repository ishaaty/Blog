            about a month ago, blackpink released their 2nd studio album born pink.
            i love blackpink; their music is so cool and fun.
            and especially after 0 music from them in 2021, i had high expectations for this album.
            overall, its ok. nothing extrodinary, but not bad either. there are some songs from here i can see myself listening
            to even a few years from now. here's how i would rank the songs (from least to most favorite):

            8. Yeah Yeah Yeah
            i have probably only listened to this song once or twice. their vocals were great, but i personally didnt like
            the theme of the song. maybe i have gotten too used to dark blackpink songs.

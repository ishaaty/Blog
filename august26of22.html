            i woke up at around 10.30, which is actually one of my best times, considering that some days during the summer
            i woke up at 1.

            i had paneer kulcha for brunch. its a flatbread stuffed with paneer. i had the frozen kulcha, which needed to be heated up.
            however, i didnt heat it up properly. its supposed to be heated on a stove with oil and all for 5 minutes, but i didn't even leave it 
            on the pan for a minute or two. so it ended up being hard in the center and soft on the outside. and when i tried 
            throwing it in the microwave instead of putting it back on the pan, the entire kulcha became hard ._, i inflicted it upon myself ig.

            i went to my best friends house for her mini birthday celebration with my sister in the afternoon. we had pastries and tea;
            the pastries were from Sook Pastry, and they were delicious! i never truly appreciated fruit tarts until i had their peach 
            tart, i will be eating more in the future lol. i had it with raspberry tea, which i found to be quite strong in flavor. but im not
            a big fan of faint tea flavors either, i will need to experiment more in terms of tea flavors and brands to find
            which ones arent too strong or bland. regardless, i had a great time with my bestie and sister; we were chatting about school and life
            in general.

            shortly afterwards, i went biking to my old elementary school. its a nice area, with a big playground, and plenty of space to bike around
            in. i went behind the school and to the baseball field. the sand was nice and even, with the white lines of sand laid down and everything. 
            there was also a dude who was practicing lax nearby, using his little net-with-a-handle to throw a ball against the brick wall.  
            he was probably doing that for hours before i came by; he looked really sweaty and tired. must have been working hard to pass try-outs or something.

            after spending some time there, i biked up to a farm next to the school. there were a lot of people when i came; it looked like there was
            a birthday party for some little kids. I bought myself an apple flavored snapple and headed home.

            that was all i did today. this was the most i have ever been outside this past month oml. hopefully i can go out more when school starts,
            as september to november are the best months for going outside imo.
